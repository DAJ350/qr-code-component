## My process

I started by reviewing the starter code to check for any missing content. After adding the necessary content to the .html file, I moved on to applying the styling rules.

Using the provided Figma design files made the styling process straightforward. After reading Frontend Mentorâ€™s article on working with Figma files, I quickly adapted to the workflow and extracted the necessary design details to make the project as pixel-perfect as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS


### What I learned

I learned how to access and work with Figma design files. I also learned common Figma design conventions used by designers and developers such as the design system, the use of variables and local styles. 

### Continued development

In the future, I would like more practice working with design files. I would also like more practice working with Semantic HTML markup.
